-----------------------------------

Implementation Notes:

Parsing:
Thus far, this program parses a shell script and fills in a data structure
composed of a forest of command trees and prints out the data structure in the
tree format. This formatting signifies the order in which the commands should
be executed and how input and output should be processed.

In order to parse the shell script, the program first tokenizes each character
or set of words in the script to allow for easier reference when creating the
tree structure. Then the program finally runs an algorithm involving an
operator stack and a command stack to properly parse the operator precedence
and create the final tree structure. 

Execution Model:
This program implements the execution model by forking separate processes for each command that gets executed. &&, ||, and sequence (;) commands are running sequentially because they are conditional. Pipes (|) run in parallel if possible based on the given commands. 

-----------------------------------

Limitations:

One primary limitation of this program is that it does not eventually free the
memory allocated to create the command_stream data structure which stores each
and every command node. The reason for this limitation is that the main
function is not to be altered. This means that a free statement calling an
auxiliary function to free the memory for the structure could not be called.

Other than this, there are no other limitations which have been encountered and
documented during testing.

-----------------------------------

TODO:
- write free functions for command_stack, operator_stack, and command_stream

UPDATE:
corner cases: 
- just newlines works
- cmd;\n works
* (
  cmd
  )
